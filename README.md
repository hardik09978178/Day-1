Q.1
Ans:

Method	Description
assert()	Writes an error message to the console if the assertion is false
clear()	Clears the console
count()	Logs the number of times that this particular call to count() has been called
error()	Outputs an error message to the console
group()	Creates a new inline group in the console. This indents following console messages by an additional level, until console.groupEnd() is called
groupCollapsed()	Creates a new inline group in the console. However, the new group is created collapsed. The user will need to use the disclosure button to expand it
groupEnd()	Exits the current inline group in the console
info()	Outputs an informational message to the console
log()	Outputs a message to the console
table()	Displays tabular data as a table
time()	Starts a timer (can track how long an operation takes)
timeEnd()	Stops a timer that was previously started by console.time()
trace()	Outputs a stack trace to the console
warn()	Outputs a warning message to the console

Q.2
Ans-
 There are majorly two types of languages. First, one is Statically typed language where each variable and expression type is already known at compile time. Once a variable is declared to be of a certain data type, it cannot hold values of other data types.Example: C, C++, Java.

// Java(Statically typed) 

int x = 5  // variable x is of type int and it will not store any other type. 

string y = 'abc' // type string and will only accept string values 
Other, Dynamically typed languages: These languages can receive different data types over time. For example- Ruby, Python, JavaScript etc.

// Javascript(Dynamically typed) 

var x = 5; // can store an integer 

var name = 'string'; // can also store a string. 
JavaScript is dynamically typed (also called loosely typed) scripting language. That is, in javascript variables can receive different data types over time. Datatypes are basically typed of data that can be used and manipulated in a program.
Numbers: 5, 6.5, 7 etc.
String: “Hello GeeksforGeeks” etc.
Boolean: Represent a logical entity and can have two values: true or false.
Null: This type has only one value : null.
Undefined: A variable that has not been assigned a value is undefined.
Object: It is the most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.
